## Sample Probe Workflow

Create a probe workflow file (e.g., `tests/api-test.yml`):

```yaml
name: API Health Check
description: Test API endpoints and database connectivity

jobs:
  - name: API Tests
    steps:
      - name: Test API Health
        uses: http
        with:
          get: https://api.example.com/health
        test: "res.code == 200"
      
      - name: Test API Authentication
        uses: http
        with:
          post: https://api.example.com/auth
          json:
            username: "test"
            password: "secret"
        test: "res.code == 200 && res.body.token != ''"
      
      - name: Test Database Connection
        uses: shell
        with:
          run: |
            curl -f https://api.example.com/db-status

## Examples

### HTTP API Testing

```yaml

name: HTTP Tests
jobs:
  - name: API Endpoints
    steps:
      - name: Get Users
        uses: http
        with:
          get: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
        test: "res.code == 200 && len(res.body) > 0"
      
      - name: Create Post
        uses: http
        with:
          post: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
          json:
            title: "Test Post"
            body: "This is a test"
            userId: 1
        test: "res.code == 201"
```

### Multi-Step Workflow

```yaml
# tests/multi-step.yml
name: Multi-Step Test
jobs:
  - name: Setup and Test
    steps:
      - name: Health Check
        uses: http
        with:
          get: https://api.example.com/health
        test: "res.code == 200"
        
      - name: Get Auth Token
        uses: http
        with:
          post: https://api.example.com/login
          json:
            username: "${{ vars.TEST_USERNAME }}"
            password: "${{ vars.TEST_PASSWORD }}"
        test: "res.code == 200"
        outputs:
          token: "res.body.access_token"
      
      - name: Use Token
        uses: http
        with:
          get: https://api.example.com/protected
          headers:
            Authorization: "Bearer {{ outputs.token }}"
        test: "res.code == 200"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow file not found**
   ```
   Error: Workflow file not found: tests/my-test.yml
   ```
   - Ensure the workflow file exists in your repository
   - Check the path is relative to the repository root

2. **Probe test failures**
   ```
   ‚úò 1 job(s) failed
   ```
   - Use `verbose: 'true'` to see detailed output
   - Check your test conditions and API endpoints

3. **Permission issues**
   ```
   Permission denied
   ```
   - Ensure your runner has network access to target endpoints
   - Check if endpoints require authentication

### Debugging

Enable verbose output and response times for detailed information:

```yaml
- uses: linyows/probe-action@v1
  with:
    workflow-path: 'tests/debug-test.yml'
    verbose: 'true'
    response-time: 'true'
```
